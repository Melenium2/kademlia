# Kademlia

Implementation of Distributed Hash table protocol in pure Go.

## Why Kademila

Kademlia DHT helps to creating overlap network. Inside this network, you may to store 
any information. All information will distribute over whole network and will be available
for all nodes by some key (we store information in hashmap).

## Example

Library has simple API for now :). 

```go
// constructor signature 
func New(port uint16, knownNodesAddr []*net.UDPAddr, opts ...Option) *DHT
```

### Default config

The `knownNodesAddr` parameter represent addresses of nodes inside network, for bootstrapping.
You should know at least one address to connect to network, otherwise, you
will be alone, for moment, while another node not connect to you.

```go
addrs := []*net.UDPAddr{
	{IP: net.IPv4(1, 1, 1, 1), Port: 5222},
}

kademliaTable := kademlia.New(15483, addrs)
```

### Additional config

Protocol has some additional user configuration. You may to change all fields to you own values if needed.

```go
const (
    // ParallelCalls is a small number representing the degree of
    // parallelism in network calls, usually 3, but
    // you can set it own.
    ParallelCalls = 3
    // BucketSize is maximum bucket list size. By default, 16.
    //
    // Bucket - is a container for nodes. Nodes stored in bucket by Kademlia
    // metric (XOR a ^ b, where a and b is ID of nodes).
    BucketSize = 16
    // TableRefreshRate represent time for timer, which will run node discovery
    // algorithm.
    TableRefreshRate = 1 * time.Minute
    // LiveCheckRate represent time for timer, which will run node live checking
    // algorithm.
    LiveCheckRate = 8 * time.Second
)

// Options of DHT.
type Options struct {
	// ParallelNetworkCalls is a number of maximum concurrency call while lookup nodes process.
	//
	// By default, ParallelCalls.
	ParallelNetworkCalls int
	// BucketSize represent count of nodes containers inside DHT.
	//
	// By default, BucketSize.
	BucketSize int
	// TableRefreshRate is a time after which table will discover for new nodes.
	//
	// By default, TableRefreshRate.
	TableRefreshRate time.Duration
	// LiveCheckRate is a time after which table will ping random node. If node is unreachable
	// then table will remove it from bucket storage.
	//
	// By default, LiveCheckRate.
	LiveCheckRate time.Duration
}
```

In next example, we apply additional configuration to Kademlia table:

```go
opts := []kademila.Option{
	WithParallelCallsCount(4), 
	WithBucketSize(10),
	WithTableRefreshRate(1 * time.Minute),
	WithLiveCheckRate(2 * time.Minute),
}

addrs := []*net.UDPAddr{
	{IP: net.IPv4(1, 1, 1, 1), Port: 5222},
}

kademliaTable := kademlia.New(15483, addrs, opts...)
```

## Status

Already completed:

- Ping - Pong requests, now table can check is nodes inside buckets still alive;
- FindNode request, table can doing self-updating.

TODO:

- Persistent storage for already found nodes, and reloading these nodes after table rerun;
- Store some items inside network;
- DNS support.
